# LibrarySystem
Project made using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP. 

The plan was to create an responsive website, containing a list of books, and a functionality of adding or removing books from the list.

Tried to make the logo as a 3D Object using Spline3D, but the bad optimization of my computer made me use a .gif as logo, which caused the background of it to be white.
